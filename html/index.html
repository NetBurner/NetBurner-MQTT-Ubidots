      <h1>HTML page &quot;index.html&quot; located in module flash memory</h1>
      This page is located in on-chip flash. It will be displayed
      only when there is not an index.htm or index.html located in the
      external flash card. To verify this, you can use ftp and copy the 
      sample flash card &quot;index.html&quot; in the project
      directory of this example. 
      <br><br>
      To display a directory of the external flash card, use "DIR" in the 
      URL. For example, http://10.1.1.2/DIR. 
      <br><br>
      HTML pages used for dynamic web content that contain the FUNCTIONCALL
      HTML tags must be known at compile-time, and so must reside in the
      flash memory of the module. These pages can reference files on external
      flash cards.
